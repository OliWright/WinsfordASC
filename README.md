WinsfordASC
===========

Google AppEngine app for Winsford Swimming Club.

The app is hosted at http://winsford-asc.appspot.com/

This is a small project I'm working on as a way to teach myself
about lots of web technologies that have largely passed me by
over the last 20 years or so.

My children are active in the local swimming club so I thought
it would be good to write something to support that.

This app runs on Google AppEngine, and scrapes its data mainly from 
https://www.swimmingresults.org which is the website of British Swimming
and the ASA (Amateur Swimming Association).

The idea is to build a local database of all races for all
swimmers within the Winsford swimming club, and present it
in a way useful for swimmers, parents, club officials and coaches.

And I learn all about Python, JavaScript, CSS and HTTP while I'm
at it.

This is my first go at Python, JavaScript and CSS.  As with all
'first goes', it can be a bit messy.   I came across the Google
style guides when I was well into the project...

http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml

...so I'm trying to adopt a lot of their conventions.  But you'll
find plenty that isn't yet quite there.

My religious beliefs prevent me from putting curly braces in the
wrong place however.  So apologies to JavaScript programmers who
like to do that.

If you're interested in adapting this for another swimming club,
you'll probably be dismayed by the number of occurrances of
"Winsford" throughout the code.   That's because I'm just writing
it for myself at the moment.   Feel free to make improvements.
